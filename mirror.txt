Our file archive is publicly available at either:

	http://ftp.amigascne.org

or

	ftp://ftp.amigascne.org

As well as from a number of mirrors all over the world. We highly recommend you
use the mirror that is closest to you.

If you would like to mirror the contents of the archives, we offer rsync access
to do so. Mirroring via ftp is strictly prohibited. Furthermore, anonymous ftp
connections are bandwith limited to 300 Kbps per connection and limited to two
connections per IP. Approved mirrors must use rsync for mirroring and are not
bandwidth limited.

We have two different rsync modules available for your use:

ftp     - contains only the amigascne specific archive (i.e. /pub/amiga)
modland - contains the modland specific archive (i.e. /mirrors/ftp.modland.com)

The rsync server requires authentication. Therefore if you have a dedicated
server connected to the internet that is publicly accessible with at least
100GB of free disk space (full mirror), with rsync installed then email
cygnus[at]amigascne.org with your request. Do include your hostname and the
servers geographical location as well as your intent to mirror amigascne and/or
modland archives. Also please indicate whether you will make the mirror
available by either HTTP or FTP or both.

Once the request has been approved and you've received your account details, 
you may mirror the desired archives as follows:

amigascne archive only:

	rsync -a --delete --delete-before ftp.amigascne.org::ftp/ \
		/your/local/mirror/path/

modland archive only:

	rsync -a --delete --delete-before ftp.amigascne.org::modland/ \
		/your/local/mirror/path/

In addition, each mirror will receive a DNS alias within the amigascne.org
domain.
